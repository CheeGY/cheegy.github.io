# Introduction

This note presents a description of the relationship between the image and kernel of linear maps and the two components of bijectivity, namely injectivity and surjectivity. In a first course in linear systems theory, the following two facts are often presented as pseudo-definitions, and hence it may not be immediately obvious nor intuitive for someone new to the material. This post is an attempt to give more intuition to these facts using more precise mathematical terms.

Suppose $A$ is a linear map between two vector spaces $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, $\textit{i.e.,}$ $A: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{V}$. 

Fact 1: $A$ is $\textit{surjective}$ if the image of $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Im}(A)$, is equals to $\mathcal{V}$. 

Fact 2: $A$ is $\textit{injective}$ if the kernel of $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Ker}(A)$, is equals to the zero vector, $\{0\}$. 

To understand Fact 1, we first recall the definitions of an image of a linear map and surjectivity.

Definition 1: The image of a linear map $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Im}(A)$, is defined as the set ${v \in \mathcal{V} \,:\, \exists\, u \in \mathcal{U} \;\;s.t.\; A(u) = v}$.  

Definition 2: A linear mapping $A : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{V}$ is surjective if for all $v \in \mathcal{V}$, there exists $u \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $A(u) = v$.

These two definitions look almost identical. The only difference lies in the quantifier, "for all $v \in \mathcal{V}$", which is not in the definition of $\textbf{Im}(A)$. Hence, it is apparent that if $\textbf{Im}(A)$ contains every element of the entire range $\mathcal{V}$, then surjectivity holds. 

For Fact 2, we state the definitions of a kernel and injectivity.
Definition 3: The kernel of a linear map $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Ker}(A)$, is defined as the set ${u \in \mathcal{U}: A(u) = 0}$.

Definition 4: A linear mapping $A : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{V}$ is injective if for all $x,y \in \mathcal{U}$, if $A(x) = A(y)$, then $x=y$.

This may not be as obvious as Fact 1. To show this, observe that since $A$ is a linear map, for any $x,y \in \mathcal{U}$,

$A(x) = A(y) \Leftrightarrow A(x) - A(y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow A(x-y) = 0$

This condition corresponds exactly to the definition of $\textbf{Ker}(A)$. If $\textbf{Ker}(A)$ is equals to the zero vector $\{0\}$, then $x-y = 0$. Hence, $x = y$ and $A$ is injective.

If $A$ is both surjective and injective, then $A$ is said to be $\textit{bijective}$. In that case, the inverse map $A^{-1}$ exists, $\textit{i.e.}$, $A^{-1}(v) = u$ is well defined and admissible.
