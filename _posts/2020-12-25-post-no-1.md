# Introduction

This note presents a description of the relationship between the image and kernel of linear maps and the two components of bijectivity, namely injectivity and surjectivity. In a first course in linear systems theory, the following two facts are often presented at surface value, and it may not be immediately obvious for someone new to the material. 

# Setup

Suppose $A$ is a linear map between two vector spaces $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$, \textit{i.e.,} $A: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{V}$. 

Fact 1: $A$ is \emph{surjective} if the image of $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Im}(A)$, is equals to $\mathcal{V}$. 

Fact 2: $A$ is \emph{injective} if the kernel of $A$, denoted by $\textbf{Ker}(A)$, is equals to the zero vector, $\{0\}$.
