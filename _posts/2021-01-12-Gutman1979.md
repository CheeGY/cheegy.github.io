## Problem setup
In this paper, an uncertain dynamical system of the following form is considered

\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = f(x,t) + \Delta f(x,t,\nu) + B(x,t)u + \Delta B(x,t,v)u + C(x,t)w, \notag
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x(t_0) = x_0, u \in U, (\nu,v,w) \in \Omega, \notag
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the state, $u$ is the control input, $(\nu, v, w)$ is the uncertainty vector. Notably, the dynamical system is affine in $u$ and $B,\Delta B \in \mathbb R^{n \times m}$.

Furthermore, it is assumed that this system fulfills **matching conditions**, which implies that there exists a continuous functions $h(x,t,\nu)$, $D(x,t)$ and $E(x,t,v)$ such that
- $\Delta f(x,t,\nu) = B(x,t) h(x,t,\nu)$
- $\Delta B(x,t,v) = B(x,t) E(x,t,v)$
- $C(x,t) = B(x,t) D(x,t)$

These matching conditions imply that the system can be formulated such that the uncertainty vector $(\nu, v, w)$ enters the system through the same channels as the input. Qualitatively, this also means that the uncertainty vector does not affect the system more than $u$. Hence, the system can be reduced to
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = f(x,t) = B(x,t)(u + \eta),
\end{equation}
where $\eta = h(x,t,\nu) + E(x,t,v)u + D(x,t)w$.

The combined uncertainty, $\eta$ is assumed to be in the set
\begin{equation}
V := \\{ \eta \in \mathbb R^m : ||\eta||\leq \rho(x,t)\\}. 
\end{equation}

The goal is to find a control policy such that uniform asymptotic stability is achieved.

## Background
### Generalized Dynamical Systems (GDS) 
In a GDS, a function $F(x_0, t_0, t)$ assigns a set $F(x_0, t_0, t) \subset \mathbb R^n$ for every $x_0 \in \mathbb R^n$, $t_0 \in \mathbb R$ and $t \geq t_0$. This function is known as the attainability function. For more details on GDS, refer to
- E. Roxin, _On generalized dynamical systems defined by contingent equations_, J. of Differential Eq., vol. 1, pg 188-205, 1965.

### Contingent equations
In this paper and related papers, the stabilizing control strategy formulated is a discontinuous design. Therefore, this concept of _contingent equations_ is introduced to define the notion of a solution in the context of GDS.

Given a curve $x(t)$, the set of $y \in \mathbb R^n$ such that there exists $\{t_i\}$, $i \in \mathbb N$, $t_i \to t_0$, $t_i \neq t_0$, and
\begin{equation}
y = \lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{x(t_i) - x(t_0)}{t_i - t_0} \notag
\end{equation}
is called the contingent derivative of $x(t)$ at $x(t_0)$, denoted by $D^*x(t)$. Geometrically, it is a set of straight lines through a point (a cone) or two sets of half lines (a forward and backward cone). 

The expression $D^*x \subset E(x,t) \subset \mathbb R^n$, where  $E(x,t)$ depends on $(x,t)$ is known as the contingent equation. Solving this means to find all curves $x(t)$ that satisfy this subset constraint. 

Existence of solutions is guaranteed if the set $E(x,t)$ defined on some closed neighborhood of $(x_0,t_0)$ is compact, convex and upper semicontinuous.

## Asymptotic stability of uncertain systems
Given the system stated in (1) with uncertainty set (4), if it is assumed that the free system $\dot{x} = f(x,t)$ is uniformly asymptotically stable, or stabilizable and if there exists a positive definite Lyapunov function $V(x,t)$ that fulfills these conditions,
- Radial unboundedness: $\gamma(\|\|x\|\|) \to \infty$ as $\|\|x\|\| \to \infty$, where $\gamma(\|\|x\|\|)$ is a lower bound of $V(x,t)$,
- $W_0(x,t) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \nabla_x V \cdot f$ is negative definite,

then, a control input that satisfies
\begin{equation}
\min_u \max_{\eta} \nabla_x V \cdot B(u + \eta) \leq 0, \quad \forall (x,t) \notag
\end{equation}
will achieve uniform asymptotic stability. In particular, this control input is obtained by formulating (1) as a contingent equation where $u$ selects values from a set-valued function and is given by $u \in p(x,t)$ where 
\begin{aligned}
p(x,t) = \begin{cases}
            -\rho(x,t) \frac{B^T(x,t) \nabla_x^T V(x,t)}{||B^T(x,t) \nabla_x^T V(x,t)||}, & \forall (x,t) \notin N \\\\
            \\{u : \|\|u\|\| \leq \rho(x,t)\\} &\forall (x,t) \in N
            \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
and
\begin{equation}
N := \\{(x,t): B^T(x,t) \nabla_x^T V(x,t) = 0\\}. \notag
\end{equation}

This result can be generalized in terms of the uncertainty set described in (2).
